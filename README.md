# ArUco-tracker
A Python program using OpenCV for offline analysis of ArUco markers recorded Bonsai, developed by Ray Shen (University of Maryland) who worked with the OpenBehavior Project in the summer of 2025.

This program reliably detects and tracks ArUco markers and extracts not only the markerâ€™s position coordinates but also its rotation angle over the given time interval.

A description of the program and the rationale for developing it is described here: https://edspace.american.edu/openbehavior/2025/07/11/aruco-markers-and-bonsai/
